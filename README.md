# Heart Disease Prediction: Exploratory Analysis and Predictive Modeling using BRFSS 2020 Dataset.

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting heart disease using the BRFSS 2020 dataset. By utilizing data exploration techniques and predictive modeling algorithms, I aim to gain insights into the factors contributing to heart disease and develop a predictive model.

To understand the development process and results in detail, please refer to the accompanying Jupyter notebook. The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the steps involved, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.

Additionally, I prepared a presentation slide that offers a concise overview of the project's methodology, key findings, and results. It provides a visual representation of the project's workflow and highlights the most important aspects of the analysis and predictive modeling process.

I encourage you to review both the notebook and presentation slide for a comprehensive understanding of our work. By leveraging the BRFSS 2020 dataset, I aim to contribute to the field of heart disease analysis and prediction, ultimately assisting in early detection and prevention strategies.
